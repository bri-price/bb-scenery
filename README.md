# Brecon Beacons Scenery

This is an add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator to correct some of the scenery around the Brecon Beacons national park in Wales. (Specifically, all the trees auto generated by the foliage generator).

I offer no guarantees as to its accuracy or even that it will work, but you are free to use, copy and modify for you own use if you want to.
